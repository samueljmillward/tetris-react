A small game project based around the classic retro arcade game Tetris! Code is written entirely in React using hooks and styled-components. 

Play a few rounds of React-Tetris at [reacttetris.netlify.app](reacttetris.netlify.app)!

Features: 

- Arrow key controls
- Scoreboard
- Advanced Levels

This project was very different to anything else I've made in React :sweat_smile:. Creating a game (Rather than a website!) in React, naturally presents a lot of unique issues never encountered in previous projects. 

However, React Tetris taught me a lot about advanced Javascript, file management, appropriate naming conventions and of course React hooks.
